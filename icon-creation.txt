For the PWA icons, you'll need to create two image files:

1. icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
2. icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

You can use a simple heart emoji or other love-themed image as your icon.

Quick ways to create these icons:

1. Use an online tool like https://favicon.io/
2. Use a graphic design tool like Canva
3. Convert an existing image to the right size

Once created, place these files in the root directory of your project.

These icons will allow your girlfriend to add the love letter to her home screen like an app.
